# I won a Futsal Tournament
I won an official futsal tournament in my college. SIUUUUUUUUUU

![Trophy](https://i.postimg.cc/SNt90KYD/Futsal-Trophy.jpg)

Our team Deewar FC:
- Me
- Ayush
- Sparsh
- Jit
- Vedant
- Kamal Balwani

It was a 5-a-side tournament. I played the role of a high pressing striker alternating with Vedant whenever either of us was tired.

The strategy worked wonders in the semi-final and final against Amogh and Avijit respectively. 

The strategy was simple, don't let their best players have the ball.
Stop them from initialising plays and carrying the ball forward.
This greatly stopped their team's ability to play as they would like to do.

The tournament started on 2025-08-11 and ended on 2025-08-14.

### First Day (2025-08-11)
We had our first match on 2025-08-11 1830 hours.

I started in the second half and scored with my second touch of the ball lol

### Second Day (2025-08-13)
We had two matches against 
- South Indian team
- Manas' team (Manas, Tejas, Luv, Tarun, etc)

I kinda gave away a goal against South Indian team.
I received the ball on the right wing and I had no options in the front so
I played a backward pass to Ayush.
But the weight on the ball was light and I was hoping Ayush would come forward to receive the ball.
Ayush stayed back and one of the opponent was able to contest for the ball.
They won the ball and were somehow able to score a goal.

Kamal scored a long range screamer and then we won on penalties.

Against Manas' team Kamal won the ball on the half line.
I carried the ball forward and after faking a shot played a pass to Sparsh to score inside an open goal.

He took the shot and it was blocked opposing player inside the semi-circle which resulted in a penalty in our favour.

Jit took the penalty and scored.

### Third Day (2025-08-14)
Semi-final against Amogh's team.

Plan was simple, DON'T let Amogh have the ball.
We won on penalties.

Final against Avijit's team.
Same plan, DON'T let Avijit have the ball.
We won on penalties. SIIIIIUUUUUUUU

### Prize Distribution
On 2025-08-15 we were felicitated for winning the Futsal Tournament.

We went to auditorium to receive our award, medal and certificate.
