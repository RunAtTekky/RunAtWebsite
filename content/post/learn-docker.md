I was tinkering through [Omarchy](/post/arch_btw) keybindings.

One keybinding was SUPER + D which opens [Docker](https://docker.com)

So I decided to learn docker through [Docker 101 Tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/)

> Just run this simple command
```bash
docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

Now open localhost and that is it.

It will open a guide on getting started with docker.
Follow along and by the time you end the tutorial you will have knowledge of the following:

- Why docker?
- What is Dockerfile, image and container?
- Running someone else's application easily through docker
- Being able to change the code and see changes directly on your app running on a container without having to stop and rerun container
- Sharing your app with others through [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- Persisting your database
- Using multi container apps
    - One container runs your app
    - One container runs your database
- Using docker compose to simplify the process of running multiple containers at once on the same network

> Now you can go through someone's github repository and run one command 
and all of the environment will be setup for you.
