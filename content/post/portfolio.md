# Portfolio: Terminal-Inspired Website
Today I was looking for inspiration for my portfolio, which I need to use on my newly aquired domain, [runat.xyz](https://runat.xyz) SIIIIIUU

I discovered [this](https://jkartik.in/) website by Kartik Jain which perfectly aligns with my interests.

> This guy used plain HTML-CSS-JS, no fancy frameworks. DAMN.

## Idea
The idea is simple, you have a terminal and you can run commands.
This is such an apt portfolio for terminal nerds like me.

These are some of the commands he uses:
```bash
whoami
github
linkedin
neofetch
help
projects
skills
awards
clear
exit
```

## My goal?
I will try recreating it with some improvements and adjustments of my own.
I will be documenting my progress here as I build it.
