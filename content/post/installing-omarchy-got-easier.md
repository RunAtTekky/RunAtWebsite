Installing Arch just got easier.

The old method to install Omarchy on your computer was a bit hard; now it is the easiest operating system install you are ever going to do.

### Step 1: Download and put the ISO on a USB

You need to download the Omarchy ISO file from [omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org/)

You can use [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) on Windows or Mac; on Linux you can use [caligula](https://github.com/ifd3f/caligula) to put the ISO on the USB stick.

### Step 2: Turn off secure boot in your computer's BIOS and use your USB as the first booting option.
### Step 3: Insert the USB and ta-da.... You are using the Omarchy installer.

It asks you the following:
- Keyboard: Super useful for me as I use DVORAK
- username
- password
- hostname (optional)
- name (optional)
- email (optional)
- Timezone

And that is it.
You do not need to connect to the internet for the installation; everything is done through the ISO.

By the end of it you have a very beautiful, productive and clean setup.
