Yoooooo It has been 1 year since I switched fully to linux.

I started off with Linux Mint in October 2024

I used and riced the heck out of it till August 2025
and then I switched to Omarchy

And now I'm done with ricing and would like to focus on actual productivity

## Why I Use Linux?
Coz I'm lazy

YES. It might sound weird but this is the actual reason.

It all started in 8th standard when I learnt how to touch type.

Ever since that day I always looked for keyboard shortcuts.

In 12th standard I learnt Dvorak coz I found out that QWERTY is built to slow you down.

In my 2nd year of B.Tech I started studying DSA.

Some of Primeagen's videos came on my feed. I liked his videos.

Then I came across his video 'Why I use VIM as my editor?'

And that is the day everything changed.

I started using VIM Motions.
Then I started using Neovim.
Then I realised windows is terrible and I started using VMware to run linux mint and used to program there.

In October 2024 I dual booted (Windows + Linux Mint).
From November 2024 I started ricing my computer.

> Now you might be wondering if I had to learn so much 
why do I say that I'm lazy

Using a keyboard centric workflow is much much faster and as Primeagen says
I don't want any mental overhead

Let's take an example
Let's say you have a few things open on your computer
- Editor
- Browser
- Spotify
- WhatsApp

Now If you are on Windows or Mac
how do you switch to these apps

Well you might be ALT tabbing your way
or maybe you are using your mouse or touchpad to click on the taskbar

But in both these tasks your eyes need to search and read for the app you want to open

Now this might not sound a lot of work but when you do this 1000s of times every single day

Your brain gets frieeeeeed

So I'm lazy and I don't want to read while alt tabbing

And I don't use my mouse coz moving from my keyboard to mouse and then back to keyboard is too much work for me

And keep in mind that if you are using your mouse you have to do that like 1000s of times every single day

So I use a window manager and I know that on these workspace I will have these apps open
- 1 -> Note taking app
- 2 -> Browser
- 3 -> Terminal / Editor
- 4 -> Videos
- 8 -> WhatsApp or messaging app

So whenever I want to go to my browser I do not have to even think my hands just goes SUPER+2
When I want terminal my hands just go SUPER+3

I have no mental overhead and neither do I have to move my hand from my keyboard.

## What I want from my computer
- Dvorak keyboard layout
- Keyboard driven code editor (Neovim)
> Coz its better duh

- Window Manager / Compositor (Hyprland)
> For keyboard driven navigation

- File Manager (Yazi)
> Keyboard driven file manager


### Tools and software I use:
- ZSH
- Terminal Emulator (Kitty)
- Terminal Multiplexer (Zellij)
- Keyboard based image viewer (Swayimg)
- Keyboard based PDF viewer (Zathura)
- Keyboard based video player (MPV)
- Keyboard based audio player (kew)
- Zoxide and fzf
- Nerdfonts
- Note taking app (Obsidian)
- Zen browser

- Clipboard history (just use walker's inbuilt clipboard)
- Atuin (Magical Shell history)

> I don't remember the rest but these are the most important ones right now
