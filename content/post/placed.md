Phew. I have been placed at [Tekion Corp](https://tekion.com/) :)

My final [college exams](/post/college_exam) ended on 2025-08-20 and I have been placed on 2025-09-01.
It couldn't have been any better.
There was no overlap between my academics and my hiring process.

## Shortlisting
It was an on-campus opportunity and to my shock I was shortlisted.

I was not getting shortlisted in other companies 
because of my CGPA being 8.54

So I wasn't even searching for my name in shortlists.
I was thinking I won't be shortlisted this soon (in August end) only 9+ CGPA people will be shortlisted
which was actually true for the most part.

This was the only company I was shortlisted for till now (August end)

But then Charchit messaged me 'All the best for Tekion' and only then I realised I had been shortlisted

Thank you Charchit

## Hiring process
### Online Assessment
On 2025-08-24 I had to go through the Tekion Online Assessment along with 241 students from all 4 campuses (52 from my campus)

Then on 2025-08-26 Online Assessment result was revealed and 17 students were shortlisted for interviews (2 from my campus)

### First Round
Data structures and Algorithms Round

- Graph - NetworkDelay problem
- Number of distinct elements in subarray of size k

> I went to our college's lab complex for interview

> Round was scheduled for 1000-1100 but for some reason mine was rescheduled for 1200-1300

### Second Round
After reading all the Interview Experiences for [Tekion](https://tekion.com) I was expecting [Low Level Design](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/what-is-low-level-design-or-lld-learn-system-design/) round.
I had even bought a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/system_design_lld_hld/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) for 399 and studied from it.

But to my surprise the interview was based on frontend 
which was later converted to LLD round coz I didn't know jackshit frontend

> Round was from 1600 till 1700

> After this round I had lost hope of going through to the HR round.

> I was returning from lab complex to hostel having lost all hope of progressing further

> Reached my room and was about to change from formal to casual clothes

> Then I got an email and my HR round was scheduled from 1930 to 2000

### Third Round
HR Round.

Questions around my personal projects and group projects.

> Even said Hala Madrid to my interviewer lol

## Result
On 2025-09-01 Interview results were revealed and I was selected for Tekion Corp along with 2 others

> Harsh broke this news to me. Thanks Harsh

So it went like this:
- 241 Online Assessment (52 from my campus)
- 17 Interviews (2 from my campus)
- 3 Selected (1 from my campus)

And to think that this was the only company I was shortlisted for.
