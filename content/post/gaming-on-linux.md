I finally tried gaming on Linux!

All you need is [Lutris](https://lutris.net/).

Currently I have the following games installed:
- Outlast
- GTA San Andreas
- GTA V

You need to install the games through Lutris

Set the executable file i.e. `OutlastLauncher.exe` in that games' configuration

And BOOM! You can play _quacked_ games on Linux
