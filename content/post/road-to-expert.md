Well well well... It is time to grind.

## Timeline
I started DSA in June 2023.

I was focusing mainly on Leetcode during the initial phase.

By September end I met some people in my hostel who were into Competitive Programming.

> Hi Shyam, Charchit, Prakhar

I started Codeforces seriously from this point.

From 21st September 2023 to 22nd April 2024, I was on the grind. I was giving almost every possible contest.

We had a WhatsApp group "CP Gaizzzzz", almost everyone in that group attended contests during this time.

By January 2024 I had become Pupil (1200+) on Codeforces

From April 2024 due to academic pressure I was not able to devote much of my time to Competitive Programming.

As a result, since January 2024 till September 2025 I'm still a Pupil on Codeforces.

## Goal
I wish to reach expert (1600+) on Codeforces by June 2026.
